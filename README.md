# Dice-Player
 Dice Player is a simple and fun dice game simulator written in Python, where users roll virtual dice and compete against the computer. Unlike traditional six-sided dice, this game uses a range of 1 to 13, adding a unique twist and more variability to the gameplay. It’s a great project for learning and practicing key programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and random number generation.

Players take turns rolling the die, with each roll producing a random number between 1 and 13. The scores are added up, and the player with the highest total wins. The game includes a straightforward, text-based interface that's easy to use and understand — perfect for beginners.

This project was built as a lightweight introduction to game logic in Python and can be a great foundation for future enhancements such as multi-round gameplay, score history, or even a graphical user interface.
